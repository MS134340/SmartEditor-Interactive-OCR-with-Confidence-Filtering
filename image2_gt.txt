Participant 1:
One effective solution is rainwater harvesting. By collecting and storing rainwater, communities can
ensure a supplementary water supply during dry seasons. Additionally, desalination plants can
provide clean water from seawater, especially in regions with abundant coastlines.
Participant 2:

efficient water usage at home, in industries, and in agriculture can significantly cut down on
unnecessary water wastage.
