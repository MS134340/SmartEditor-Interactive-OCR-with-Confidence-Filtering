“I’m sorry, Ann.”
“This hurts too much.”
“Look, I’ve been where you are. I’ve wanted to end everything.
And I’m standing here right now telling you I’m glad I didn’t. I’m glad I
had the strength to ride it out. This low point isn’t the book of your
life. It’s just a chapter.”
“What happened to you?”
“I lost my daughter. Life has broken my heart too.”
Ann looks at the incandescent skyline. “Do you have photos of
her? Do you still talk with people about her?”
“Yes.”
“At least she once existed.”
There is simply nothing he can say to that.
Ann looks down through her legs again. She kicks off one of her
pumps.
Watches it fall.
Then sends the other one plummeting after it.
“Ann, please.”
“In my previous life, my false life, Joe’s first wife, Franny, jumped
from this building, from this ledge actually, fifteen years ago. She had
clinical depression. I know he blamed himself. Before I left his house
on Long Island, I told Joe I was going to jump from the Poe Building
tonight, just like Franny. It sounds silly and desperate, but I hoped
he’d show up here tonight and save me. Like he failed to do for her.
At first, I thought you might be him, but he never wore cologne.” She
smiles—wistful—then adds, “I’m thirsty.”
Barry glances through the French doors and the dark office, sees
two patrolmen standing at the ready by the reception desk. He looks
back at Ann. “Then why don’t you climb down from there, and we’ll
walk inside together and get you a glass of water.”
“Would you bring it to me out here?”
“I can’t leave you.”
Her hands are shaking now, and he registers a sudden resolve in
her eyes.
She looks at Barry. “This isn’t your fault,” she says. “It was always
going to end this way.”
“Ann, no—”
